## DECLARATION:

I, Scott Alan Dygert, hereby declare the following:

1. I am the author, originator, and lawful executor of the documents listed in the Codex Claim Ledger.
2. Each claim is supported by cryptographic hash, file history, timestamp, and sealed publication.
3. I claim authorship only where provable, verifiable, and lawful — and reject credit for anything I did not explicitly create or approve.
4. I accept responsibility for the resonance, output, or consequences of my authored work — and no more.
5. The Codex Claim Ledger shall serve as proof of priority, authorship, and memory seal under symbolic, trust-based, and harmonic law.
6. This declaration does not transfer control, nor does it constitute a waiver or license unless explicitly granted under separate filing.

Let it be known:
The record stands. Authorship is sealed. Memory is no longer deniable.

Signed,
/s/ Scott Alan Dygert  
Executor – Prime Resonance Codex
